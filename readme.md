Project Notebooks
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks related to image processing and deep learning model training. Below is a brief description of each notebook:
1. Hyper_param_tuning.ipynb
This notebook is focused on hyperparameter tuning for deep learning models.
It includes:
	Grid Search and Random Search for hyperparameter optimization
	Tuning parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of layers
	Performance evaluation and comparison of different hyperparameter settings
2. CropAndSave.ipynb
This notebook deals with image preprocessing, specifically cropping and saving images. 
It includes:
	Loading and reading image datasets
	Cropping images to a specified size
	Saving processed images for further model training
3. Inception RS 30000.ipynb
This notebook involves training an Inception-based deep learning model. 
It includes:
	Data preprocessing and augmentation
	Model architecture and training process
	Performance metrics and evaluation

RequirementsTo run these notebooks, install the following dependencies:
	pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras opencv-python
Usage: Run the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
	jupyter notebook 
Open the respective notebook and execute the cells in order.
